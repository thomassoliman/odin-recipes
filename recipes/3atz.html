    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Egyptian Red Lentil Soup, known as Shorbet Ads, is a hearty, comforting, and nutritious dish that is a staple in Egyptian cuisine. Made primarily from red lentils, this soup has a rich, velvety texture and a deep golden color, often enhanced with warming spices like cumin, coriander, and turmeric.</p>
        
        <p>The soup typically starts with sautéed onions, garlic, and sometimes carrots or tomatoes, which add depth of flavor. The lentils are then simmered in water or vegetable broth until soft, then blended to create a smooth, creamy consistency. A squeeze of fresh lemon juice is often added at the end to brighten the flavors.</p>
        
        <p>Red Lentil Soup is commonly served with flatbread (baladi bread) or crispy pita chips, making it a perfect dish for dipping. It’s a beloved comfort food, especially during winter or Ramadan, and is naturally vegan, protein-rich, and easy to prepare.</p>
